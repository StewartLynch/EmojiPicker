## üöÄ Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use `EmojiPicker`:

### Presenting the Emoji Picker

```swift
import EmojiPicker

@State private var allCategoriesEmoji = "üòÄ" // Emoji to update
@State private var showPicker = false

var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Button("Pick an Emoji") {
            showPicker = true
        }
    }
    .sheet(isPresented: $showPicker) {
        EmojiPicker(
            selectedEmoji: $allCategoriesEmoji
        )
    }
}
```

### Customizing Categories

You can restrict the emojis shown using specific category filters:

```swift
EmojiPicker(
    selectedEmoji: $mixedCategoriesEmoji,
    limitedCategories: [.foodAndDrink, .smileyAndEmotion]
)
```

Or use just one specific category:

```swift
EmojiPicker(
    selectedEmoji: $singleCategoryEmoji,
    limitedCategories: [.activities]
)
```

### Search Terms

Or provide your own search term and pass that in as a String:

```swift
EmojiPicker(
    selectedEmoji: $searchTermEmoji,
    searchTerm: "love"
)
```

### Presenting as a Popover

Instead of a sheet presentation, you may wish to present the picker as a popover.

On iOS this requires the `.presentationCompactAdaptation(.popover)` modifier:

```swift
.popover(isPresented: $showSingle) {
    EmojiPicker(
        selectedEmoji: $singleCategoryEmoji,
        limitedCategories: [.objects]
    )
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
    .presentationCompactAdaptation(.popover)
}
```
